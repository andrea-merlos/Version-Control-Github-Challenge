1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words.

The terminal allows us to communicate with the computer by inserting commands and seeing the results.

2. What is the major difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is a tool you download in the terminal that keeps up with changes and more information.  GitHub is a website where you can upload git repositories online, making it easier to work with a group and share projects. 

3.  What are the steps to fork a GitHub repository?

First, go to the repository you want to fork and click on it. Then you click on the right button that reads Fork. When you want to open the file on the terminal, copy the URL using the Code button under SSH. Once you have the URL copied, open up the terminal type "get clone" followed by the URL you copied and press enter.
